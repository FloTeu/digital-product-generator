Next, you must add bullet points to the Amazon product listing. These points appear next to the product images and describe your product benefits in detail. You can use relevant keywords in these bullet points to improve your product ranking in the search result. 
Here are some more tips for creating the bullet points:
Start each bullet points with a capital letter.
Sellers can add five bullet points, and vendors are allowed to add ten bullet points.
Write as sentence fragments, and do not use ending punctuation.
Describe five features and benefits of your product in the bullet points
Ensure all the bullet points have a similar length, not too long or short. 
Avoid using promotional content, discounts, and offers in the bullet points
Don’t use HTML or other coding elements to create fancy symbols or emojis in the bullet points.

In this field, give your brand name. Amazon may ask you to provide evidence if the brand is not registered. You can submit images of your product and it’s packaging with your brand name.

This is the product title shoppers would see in the product listing. The key is to make sure the product name is detailed and consists of relevant keywords. 

Here are some points to keep in mind while giving the product title:

Make sure the product title matches the physical packaging of your product.
Capitalize the first letter of each word except for prepositions, conjunctions, or articles.
Keep the title detailed, with a keyword, brand name, at least one benefit, and other details if possible. The recommended title length is 80 to 200 characters.
Use numerals like “2” instead of “two.”
Don’t use non-language ASCII characters like Æ, ©, or ®.
Don’t use promotional phrases like “Hot Item,” “Best Seller,” or Free shipping worldwide.
Punctuation like hyphens, forward slashes, commas, ampersands, and periods are okay to use in titles.
You can use abbreviations for measurements like “cm,” “oz,” “in,” and “kg.”
Include the size and color variations in the product titles for your child’s ASINs
Finally, review the product title requirements and follow the criteria to appear in relevant searches and avoid search suppression.

Note: Start the title with your brand name and your primary keyword, as Amazon will automatically generate canonical URLs based on the title you give.
